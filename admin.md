# Administration

### How can we send commands ("SLEEP", "RESTART", "ARE-YOU-THERE", etc.) to individual nodes in the network, rather than treat them as pass-through intermediaries?
- Like when sending a card to a specific individual on the UW campus,
  each node can have a unique identifier. So when designating the intended recipient node,
  we can attach the destination's unique identifier to the command card.
