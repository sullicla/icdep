# Anti-Duplication

### How can we ensure that each card is received once and only once?
- Through attaching unique identifiers or tokens to each card, we can ensure <br>
that we are not receiving duplicates to each respective card. So each node can verify <br>
individually that the unique identifier/node hadn't been received before <br>
With this, we can also make sure that the message can only be passed <br>
once at a time. This way, the cards won't be received in the incorrect order <br>
is less likely to get mixed up with other cards.
